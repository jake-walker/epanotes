| TC | 7 | Design, implement and analyse algorithms. | Design, implement and analyse algorithms for solving problems. |
| TC | 10 | Apply secure programming principles and design patterns to address security issues. | Apply secure programming principles to analyse software designs and implementations to mitigate identified security vulnerabilities to produce more resilient code, with evidence.<br><br>Apply secure design patterns and organisational coding standards in the development of a software solution. |
| TC | 11 | Apply system engineering and software development methodologies and models. | Apply a systematic software development methodology, employing appropriate tools, to develop a solution that meets the needs of users and customers and that addresses the whole lifecycle. <br><br>Create a system description of a complex system of interest including aspects of people, culture, technology and process in a defined environment. Use the system description to identify and analyse security aspects. |
| TKU | 6 | Algorithm and program design concepts, compilers and logic. Programming languages. | Understand: algorithms and program design; fundamental programming concepts; fundamental data structures; typical program development environment and methods.<br><br>Understand that programming languages are the medium through which programmers precisely define concepts, formulate algorithms, and reason about solutions: object-oriented programming; functional programming; event driven and reactive programming; language translation and execution; syntax analysis; compiler semantic analysis; code generation; coding in assembler; machine code; scripting language. |
| TKU | 7 | Algorithms, complexity and discrete maths. | Understand the central concepts of algorithms and complexity: analysis; algorithmic strategies; fundamental data structures and strategies; automata, computability and complexity.<br><br>Understand the foundations of discrete mathematics applied to computing: sets, relations and functions; logic and proof techniques; graphs and trees. |
| TKU | 10 | Defensive programming, malware resistance, code analysis, formal methods, good practice. | Knowledge and understanding of defensive programming (input validation, least privilege, defence in depth, data sanitization, etc.)<br><br>Understanding of how to resist malware techniques (memory corruption, code injection, user/kernel space vulnerabilities, privilege escalation, etc.)<br><br>Use of design patterns for developing secure software.<br><br>Understand how to use compiler features to support creation of secure code.<br><br>Understand how to apply static and dynamic code analysis techniques. <br><br>Obtain and apply sources of secure programming practices, including employer or software development organisation, for different types of software systems (OWASP, CERT, etc.).<br><br>Describe at least 1 formal method (e.g. CSP) that may be applied to software development and its strengths and weaknesses when applied to development of software with security properties. Defensive programming |
| TKU | 11 | System development principles, tools, approaches, complexity, software engineering. | Understand of how the different aspects in a software development lifecycle combine to deliver a successful outcome. (Considering: meeting a need, design, trade-offs, implementation, deployment, support, evolution, validation, verification and assurance). <br><br>Describe different approaches to developing software, including sequential, iterative/agile approaches. <br><br>Give an explanation of the advantages and disadvantages of different software development processes, and justify choice of process in different contexts. <br><br>Understand how to select and use different tools and environments that support software development at different stages in the lifecycle.<br><br>Understand the principles of systems engineering, including all aspects of technology, people, culture and process and the environment within which a system of interest exists and operates.<br><br>Explain the benefits of a system approach to dealing with challenges arising from complexity, emergence, adaption and co-evolution. |
| UPIBKS |  | Fluent in written communications and able to articulate complex issues. | Produce well-structured and concise written work that sets out complex technical matters in ways which that would be accessible to non-technical recipients as well as technical staff (as appropriate). |
| UPIBKS |  | Analytical and critical thinking skills for Technology Solutions development and can systematically analyse and apply structured problem-solving techniques to complex systems and situations. | Evaluate information and then make a rational decision on the approach to take to solve the problem, based on their findings; spot trends in data and articulate the implications. |
| UPIBKS |  | Can conduct effective research, using literature and other media. | Put into practice sound research techniques (using literature and other media) and articulate in writing and/or verbally how they have utilised the findings in their work. |
| UPIBKS |  | Logical thinking and creative approach to problem solving. | Observe and analyse phenomena, reactions and feedback, and draw logical conclusions based on that input. |
| UPIBKS |  | Able to demonstrate a ‘security mind-set’ (how to break as well as make). | Think about how things can be made to fail, as well as about how things can be made to work. |
| Bh |  | Demonstrates business disciplines, ethics and courtesies, demonstrating timeliness and focus when faced with distractions and the ability to complete tasks to a deadline with high quality. | Act in a professional way as required in the cyber security context. |
| Bh |  | Flexible attitude and ability to perform under pressure. | Deliver the best project outcomes against goals, re-prioritising as necessary, even in challenging circumstances. |
