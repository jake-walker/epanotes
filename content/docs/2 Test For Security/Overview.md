1. A physical demonstration of a security test of a provided network as set out in the KSBs listed.
2. A written justification for the approach taken (a 1,000 word +/- 100 words written document).

## KSBs

| Type | Index | Name | Pass Description |
| ---- | ----- | ---- | ---------------- |
| TC | 9 | Analyse malware & identify its mechanisms. | Analyse examples of malware and identify the mechanisms used by the malware. |
| TC | 12 | Discover, identify and analyse threats, attack techniques, vulnerabilities and mitigations. | Discover through a mix of research and practical exploration vulnerabilities in a system and determine their impact.<br><br>Research and investigate common and complex attack techniques including making use of relevant external sources of vulnerabilities, threat intelligence and advice. (For example. a national cyber authority, OWASP.)<br><br>Combine different sources to create an enriched view.<br><br>Demonstrate application of attack techniques in a lab setting (in a legal and ethical manner). |
| TC | 20 | Architect, analyse & justify a secure system. | Apply interpretation of security policy and risk profiles to design secure architectural solutions that meet security objectives, mitigate the risks and conform to legislation in a representative business scenario.<br><br>Critically analyse secure architectural solutions and security controls against defined security objectives to assess how effectively risks are mitigated, legal requirements and business requirements are met.<br><br>Identify and describe the means by which the risk owner can have confidence that the solution mitigates the risks to an acceptable level. |
| TC | 25 | Organise testing & investigation work in accordance with legal & ethical requirements. | Organise cyber security testing work within a legal and ethical framework (under English jurisdiction).<br><br>Organise cyber security incident investigation work within a legal and ethical framework (under English jurisdiction).<br><br>Secure evidence appropriately to support legal proceedings. |
| TKU | 9 | Malware, reverse engineering, obfuscation. | Understand the low-level mechanisms used by current malware: machine level instruction set; reverse engineering techniques; reverse engineering for malware analysis; de-obfuscation of obfuscated code; anti-debugging mechanisms. |
| TKU | 12 | Threats, vulnerabilities, impacts and mitigations in ICT systems and the enterprise environment. | Explain how cyber security concepts apply to ICT infrastructure.<br><br>Describe the fundamental building blocks and typical architectures and identify some common vulnerabilities in networks and systems. <br><br>Understand vulnerabilities in computer networks and systems (for example un-secure coding and unprotected networks) and how they can be exploited. <br><br>Understand the impact of identified vulnerabilities in the organisation’s context. <br><br>Understand the human dimension of cyber security the need to adopt an adversarial thinking approach to system development and analysis. Analyse how an employee may enable a successful attack chain without realising it. Describe some things that may increase or decrease risks related to an organisation’s ‘cyber culture’. <br><br>Identify the vulnerabilities in organisations security management system. Identify the links between physical, logical, personal and procedural security. <br><br>Describe ways to defend against cyber-attack techniques. <br><br>Describe the existing threat landscape. <br><br>Understand how to apply relevant techniques for horizon scanning, including use of recognised sources of threat intelligence, to keep the view of the threat landscape up to date.<br><br>Describe threat trends and the significance of identified trends. <br><br>Understand the threat intelligence lifecycle and the concepts of threat actors and attribution. Evaluate and describe the significance, value and limitations of a given threat analysis. |
| TKU | 21 | Assurance concepts & approaches. | Explain the difference between ‘trusted’ and ‘trustworthy’ and explain what assurance is for in security. <br><br>Describe the main approaches to assurance (intrinsic, extrinsic, design & implementation, operational policy & process) and give examples of how these might be applied at different stages in the lifecycle of a system. Describe at least one current system of extrinsic assurance (e.g. red teaming, security testing, supply chain assurance, Common Criteria) explaining the benefits and limitations. <br><br>Explain what 3rd party testing (e.g. ‘ethical hacking’) is and how it contributes to assurance. <br><br>Describe at least 2 ways an organisation can provide intrinsic assurance. |
| TKU | 25 | Applicability of laws, regulations & ethical standards. | Understand applicability of laws and regulations to security testing of 3rd parties (‘ethical hacking’, ‘pen-testing’). <br><br>Describe by reference to at least 1 generally recognised and relevant professional body the ethical responsibilities of a cyber-security professional. <br><br>Understand applicability of laws and regulation to intelligence collection and analysis, and the relationship to data protection, human rights and privacy. |
| UPIBKS |  | Fluent in written communications and able to articulate complex issues. | Produce well-structured and concise written work that sets out complex technical matters in ways which that would be accessible to non-technical recipients as well as technical staff (as appropriate). |
| UPIBKS |  | Analytical and critical thinking skills for Technology Solutions development and can systematically analyse and apply structured problem-solving techniques to complex systems and situations. | Evaluate information and then make a rational decision on the approach to take to solve the problem, based on their findings; spot trends in data and articulate the implications. |
| UPIBKS |  | Can conduct effective research, using literature and other media. | Put into practice sound research techniques (using literature and other media) and articulate in writing and/or verbally how they have utilised the findings in their work. |
| UPIBKS |  | Logical thinking and creative approach to problem solving. | Observe and analyse phenomena, reactions and feedback, and draw logical conclusions based on that input. |
| UPIBKS |  | Able to demonstrate a ‘security mind-set’ (how to break as well as make). | Think about how things can be made to fail, as well as about how things can be made to work. |
| Bh |  | Demonstrates business disciplines, ethics and courtesies, demonstrating timeliness and focus when faced with distractions and the ability to complete tasks to a deadline with high quality. | Act in a professional way as required in the cyber security context. |
| Bh |  | Flexible attitude and ability to perform under pressure. | Deliver the best project outcomes against goals, re-prioritising as necessary, even in challenging circumstances. |
